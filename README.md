# MCOTM
This repository presents MCOTM, a novel framework for intelligent task management in Industrial IoT (IIoT) environments using edge computing. It enables mobility-aware computation offloading and task migration by combining trajectory prediction, resource state forecasting, and deep reinforcement learning (DDPG).
